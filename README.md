#  Machine Learning on Catalogue quality scores dataset in Azure

## Introduction
This project has been done for practice and learning purposes in order to better my understanding of Machine Learning in Azure. 
In this project, I have performed AutoML regression as well as linear regression in python to check the root mean squared error for the column 'score' and compare which one gives the best model.

### Installation
* The dataset used is about 'Catalogue quality scores' and has been obtained from [Toronto Open Dataset website](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/catalogue-quality-scores/)
* Dependencies: [Code file link](https://github.com/shatakshipachori/data_quality_analysis.git)
* Usage: Microsoft Machine Learning Studio- Notebook
