#  Machine Learning on Catalogue quality scores dataset in Azure

## Introduction
This project has been done for practice and learning purposes in order to better my understanding of Machine Learning in Azure. 
In this project, I have performed AutoML regression as well as linear regression in python to check the root mean squared error for the columns 'score' and 'grade_norm' respectively. 

### Installation
The dataset used is about 'Catalogue quality scores' and has been obtained from Toronto Open Dataset website [](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/catalogue-quality-scores/)
